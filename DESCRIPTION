Description: R workspace with functions comprising a non-linear baseflow separation model, 
    calibrated values of parameters and estimates of the baseflow component of daily streamflow 
    at selected streamflow gages. Parameter values were determined by calibration of the model. 
    Estimates of the baseflow component include daily values and the total baseflow as a fraction 
    of streamflow for the analysis period.
